## Installing
which is the first step to use ubuntu.

and it is hard to handle...

**here are some tips**

### familiar
before install your ubuntu in a real computer, you'd better install it in a vitual machine to get familiar with it.

#### virtual machine
1. have fun using Vmware workstation player(not commercial)
it is stable but not functional, emmm...

2. have fun using Virtual box
it is... how to say... ugly

but stable.

the best point of it is...

for free

3. have fun using Vmware workstation pro(not for free and it is a high price for student!!!)
but... you know

borrow a key is not a bad choice:)

4. qemu...etc
ahhh

if you can figure out how to use it, this part can be omitted.

when install an ubuntu on a virtual machine, it is too easy(except the 4.)

just make sure your english is good enough:) (but if not you would not read this article now...)

### install on a real machine
it is a hard way to try all the methods here

but... i will tell you all i know now.

#### usb installer
emmm...

recently, usb install is a hot method to install a system(windows, linux ...etc)

because we probably have no other devices now:)

all in all

there are two usb installer here

- [Rufus](https://rufus.akeo.ie/)
- [universial usb installer](https://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/)

rufus seems to be new and well dressed

and universial usb installer seems old and... unstable sometimes

when you use your usb flash drive, remember make it as fat32, not ntfs

#### install
before installing

go into the bios

make sure
- fast boot is enable
- security boot is disable(i am not sure, cause my computer does not have this option)

## well
maybe there are sth important when install an ubuntu

but i want to play games now...

so

**good luck**
